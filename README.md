# Adventure Game using Pose Recognition
In this game, I use pose recognition to move my character. When the app starts Alfonzo will have to go to the ice creature and he will tell Alfonzo to defeat the dragon with the sword. We also get points if we touch the dragon but we lose points if we get hit by the fireballs. To play app you have to use pose recognition to move your character
Example you have to use your thumbs to move like thumbs up is to move forward and thumbs down is to move downwards
